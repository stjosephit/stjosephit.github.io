											<h3>Were can i get resources (files)?</h3>
											<p>The best way to get 3D printer files is to make them yourself, But what if you dont have the time or knowledge to create your file? Then you can download over peoples files, the biggest repository of 3d Printer projects is thingiverse, Thingiverse offers hundreds of thousand if not millions of files to print, but most importantly has an education section.</p>

											<h3>Our 3d Printer</h3>
											<p>At Saint Jospehs we are lucky enough to have a Makerbot Replicator (gen 5) supplied to us by CEDP (CEO). This 3D printer is a very capable machine with a 7.5L build volume and very high resolution this printer can print almost anything with little or no modifications to the files.</p>

										<h3>What is a 3D Printer?</h3>
										<p>3d Printing was invented in 1983, but did not become a technology acquired by schools, small businesses and people (personal) until around 2010. The main type of 3d printer is FDM (fused deposition modeling) which uses molten plastic that is extruded from a nozzle, much like a hot glue gun.</p>
										<p>But much like a conventional printer, a 3D printer needs a file to print. A 3D model can be created and saved in many formats (depending on the software) but for them to be uploaded to a 3d printer they must be in an .STL format so the printer can read them. Luckily this format is an industry standard and almost all files available on the internet are STL files.</p>
										<h3>How Can it be Used at School?</h3>
										<p>A 3D printer can be used in almost any industry, it just depends how useful it is to that specific business. 3D printers are very valuable to schools for STEM based classes but also many others. For example Printing geological sites or Historical artifacts. Here are some uses for St joseph's 3D printer:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Printing geological and historical examples.</li>
											<li>Showing mechanical examples.</li>
											<li>Showing scientific examples.</li>
											<li>STEM classes, showing how the printer works itself.</li>
											<li>Rewards for students.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>I am not a teacher though and you can probably think of many uses I never would, so if you have an idea please email or speak to me, as I believe this is an asset for the school.<p>
